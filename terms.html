  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last updated: <span id="termsDate"></span></p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>
    These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the Method website and any associated pages, content,
    services, coaching, communications, or materials provided by Method and its affiliated brands, including
    DeanMethod (collectively, “Method,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). By using the site or engaging with Method services,
    you agree to these Terms.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Educational Information Only</h2>
  <p>
    Method provides educational and informational content and coaching support. Nothing on this website or in our
    services constitutes medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. You should consult a qualified healthcare
    professional before beginning or modifying any exercise, nutrition, or health program.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Assumption of Risk</h2>
  <p>
    Physical training, exercise, and nutritional changes carry inherent risks, including the risk of injury, illness,
    or adverse outcomes. By participating in any services, you voluntarily assume all risks associated with your
    participation, whether known or unknown, and accept full responsibility for your own safety and well-being.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Eligibility, Health, and Client Responsibilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You represent that you are physically able to participate in exercise and will disclose relevant limitations, injuries, conditions, or medical guidance that may affect training.</li>
    <li>You are responsible for selecting safe training environments and using equipment appropriately.</li>
    <li>You agree to provide accurate information and to communicate changes that may affect scheduling or safety.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Services and Delivery Modes</h2>
  <p>
    Method services may be delivered in-person, online, or both, depending on availability and your needs.
    Specific deliverables, scheduling, and format may vary by plan and will be coordinated through direct communication.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Coverage and Training Location Policy</h2>
  <p>
    In-person coaching is intended for Ventura County. Online coaching may be available regardless of location.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Training location:</strong> For privacy and operational reasons, sessions are not hosted at the coach’s personal home or personal gym.</li>
    <li><strong>Equipment access:</strong> Clients are responsible for facility/equipment access (for example, a gym membership or equivalent). Coaching fees do not include facility dues or access fees.</li>
    <li><strong>Alternative training:</strong> If equipment is limited, bodyweight/calisthenics-based sessions may be used where appropriate.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Pricing Display, Promotions, and How Enrollment Works</h2>
  <p>
    This website may display example monthly pricing tiers and policy summaries for convenience. You do not purchase
    services directly through this website. Final pricing and scheduling availability are confirmed during onboarding.
  </p>
  <p>
    Method may offer limited-time promotional pricing during certain time windows. Promotional pricing is not guaranteed
    and may change or be discontinued at any time.
  </p>

  <h2>8. One-Time Session (Try 1)</h2>
  <p>
    Method may offer a one-time introductory coaching session (“Try 1”) intended as an entry session.
    The current example price displayed on the site is <strong>$60</strong>. Availability is limited and scheduling is
    coordinated directly. Try 1 is intended as a one-time purchase per client unless otherwise agreed in writing.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Monthly Plans, Session Credits, and Usage</h2>
  <p>
    Method may offer monthly subscription-style coaching plans that include a session credit cap (a maximum number of
    coaching sessions included per month). The plan tier determines the monthly session cap. Any quoted pricing,
    caps, and plan details will be confirmed at onboarding.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Promotional Rate Lock (1 Year)</h2>
  <p>
    If you enroll in a monthly plan during a promotional pricing period, Method may honor a promotional “rate lock”
    for <strong>twelve (12) months</strong> starting from your subscription activation date (the “Rate Lock Period”),
    provided your subscription remains active and in good standing.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Good standing:</strong> no unresolved chargebacks, non-payment, or account restrictions.</li>
    <li><strong>Continuity:</strong> pausing, canceling, or allowing your subscription to lapse may end the rate lock. If the rate lock ends, reactivation may be subject to then-current rates.</li>
    <li><strong>After the rate lock:</strong> after the Rate Lock Period ends, your plan renews at the then-current standard rate unless otherwise agreed in writing.</li>
    <li><strong>Scope:</strong> the rate lock applies to the subscription price of the enrolled tier and does not cover third-party fees, facility dues, or other costs outside of coaching.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>11. Rollover and Expiration</h2>
  <p>
    Unused session credits may roll over for up to one (1) additional month. After the rollover window, unused credits
    expire and are forfeited. Rollover is not guaranteed if a plan is paused, canceled, or materially changed.
  </p>

  <h2>12. Session Length and Structure</h2>
  <p>
    Sessions are generally designed to stay within 120 minutes. When needed, a strict maximum of 180 minutes may apply.
    The first session may run longer due to intake, assessment, goal setting, and planning.
  </p>

  <h2>13. Scheduling, Rescheduling, and Cancellations</h2>
  <p>
    Scheduling is coordinated directly. Please be on time to maximize your session time.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Late arrivals may reduce the remaining session time if another appointment follows.</li>
    <li>Cancellation/rescheduling rules (including any advance-notice requirements) may be provided during onboarding and may vary by plan and availability.</li>
    <li>Repeated no-shows, late cancellations, or unreasonable scheduling behavior may result in forfeiture of session credits and/or termination of services.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>14. Subscription Billing, Renewal, and Cancellation</h2>
  <p>
    Subscriptions are billed through a third-party payment provider using the secure enrollment link Method provides.
    Method does not collect or store full payment card details on this website.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unless otherwise stated at enrollment, subscriptions renew automatically at the end of each billing period until canceled.
    Cancellation takes effect according to the provider’s billing rules and the timing of your cancellation request.
    You are responsible for managing your subscription status (including cancellation) using the payment provider’s tools
    or by contacting Method for assistance.
  </p>

  <h2>15. Refunds and Chargebacks</h2>
  <p>
    Unless otherwise required by law or explicitly agreed in writing, fees are non-refundable once a billing period begins.
    Chargebacks or payment reversals may result in immediate suspension of services until resolved.
  </p>

  <h2>16. No Guarantees</h2>
  <p>
    Results vary between individuals. Method makes no guarantees regarding outcomes, performance, body composition,
    health changes, or results of any kind. You acknowledge that adherence, lifestyle factors, and individual biology
    materially affect outcomes.
  </p>

  <h2>17. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>
    To the fullest extent permitted by law, Method shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental,
    consequential, special, or exemplary damages arising from or relating to your use of the site, content, or services.
    If liability cannot be excluded, Method’s total liability shall be limited to the amount paid by you to Method in the
    relevant month in which the event giving rise to the claim occurred.
  </p>

  <h2>18. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>
    All content, branding, logos, text, graphics, and materials on Method are owned by or licensed to Method and may not
    be reproduced, distributed, or used without permission.

    Information submitted through contact forms, email, or messaging may be used to respond to your inquiry and to
    provide requested services. You are responsible for the accuracy of the information you provide.

    conflict-of-law principles.
